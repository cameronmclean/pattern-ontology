Design Pattern core concepts ontology

This document defines and provides the vocabulary to talk about common design pattern elements and their relations

Many aspects of design patterns can be descibed using existing vocabularies eg dublin core - and where suitable we prefer to use these terms directly rather than invent 
new subclasses of them here

This document therefore only covers the intrinsic core pattern elements, and is intended to be extsnsible and evolvable, and to describe design patterns independent of thier 
specific subject domains.
